# Loan_prediction_AV
This is a classification problem where we try to predict if loan will be provided to an applicant based on various features.
The dataset has 13 features and 614 rows.
I have performed the classification using Logistic regression, support vector classifier, random forest classifer, vote classifier using these three, adaboost and gradient boosting algorithm.
EDA, feature engineering, data cleaning, model training and hyper parameter tuning has been done.
